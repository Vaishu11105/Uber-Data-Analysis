Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Uber rides dataset to uncover customer booking behavior and usage trends. Built using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the project answers key business questions and provides visual insights into ride patterns:

Ride Categories – Identified the most booked category, with Business rides dominating.

Ride Purpose – Found that Work/Meetings were the most common purpose.

Peak Hours – Bookings peaked during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (5–8 PM) commute times.

Monthly Trends – Rides were least frequent in December, reflecting seasonal dips.

Weekly Trends – Fridays had the highest booking activity.

Distance Insights – Most trips fell in the 5–15 mile range, highlighting short-distance commutes.
